Easy Peasy Web Copy
================================



Description
-----------
A simple web tool to make life easier when copying from a text document into html. It uses a RegEx to wrap newlines in paragraph tags - `<p>newline</p>` and output's those into a `div`. I do plan on adding a copy to clipboard button but it seems it's impossible to do with javascript and the only alternative is **Flash** - I hate flash.

How to run
-----------
Simply cloning this repo into your local environment will do the trick. There is a working demo [here](http://sirbrad.github.com/Easy-Web-Copy/)

Feel free to use and/or alter the tool for your own projects.
